## üöÄ **READY FOR TESTING!**
Both repositories are now synchronized and the calendar logic fix is deployed. The calendar should now properly show availability for your 7 identical standard rooms with correct totals like "5/7" and proper color coding based on actual bookings.

## üìÖ **Calendar Logic Summary:**
- **7 identical standard rooms**
- **Check-in day**: Room becomes unavailable
- **Stay period**: Room remains unavailable
- **Check-out day**: Room becomes available again
- **Display**: "7/7" (green), "5/7" (yellow), "0/7" (red)

## üö® **CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES:**
1. **Room Display**: Only 1 room showing instead of 7 (investigation needed)
2. **New Feature**: Implement booking.com-like room selection and pricing display
3. **Admin Control**: Ensure pricing is controllable from admin panel

## üéâ **BOOKING WIZARD IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETED:**
- ‚úÖ **Room Details Step**: Now shows only the selected room with confirmation
- ‚úÖ **Language Context**: Preserved throughout entire booking process
- ‚úÖ **Room Data Integration**: Uses actual backend data instead of hardcoded values
- ‚úÖ **Better UX**: Clear room confirmation and next step guidance
