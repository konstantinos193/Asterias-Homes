- [ ] **Image Optimization** 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
  - [ ] **FIX**: Large image file sizes (currently 127 images, many over 200KB)
  - [ ] **IMPLEMENT**: WebP format with fallbacks
  - [ ] **ADD**: Responsive images with srcset
  - [ ] **IMPLEMENT**: Progressive image loading
  - [ ] **ADD**: CDN integration for static assets

### **🔍 COMPREHENSIVE TESTING & QUALITY ASSURANCE** 🔴 **CRITICAL FOR PRODUCTION**

## 📅 **Calendar Logic Summary:**
- **7 identical standard rooms**
- **Check-in day**: Room becomes unavailable
- **Stay period**: Room remains unavailable
- **Check-out day**: Room becomes available again
- **Display**: "7/7" (green), "5/7" (yellow), "0/7" (red)

## 🚨 **CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES:**
1. **Room Display**: Only 1 room showing instead of 7 (investigation needed)
2. **New Feature**: Implement booking.com-like room selection and pricing display
3. **Admin Control**: Ensure pricing is controllable from admin panel

## ✅ **RECENTLY FIXED CRITICAL ISSUES:**
4. **✅ Backend Booking Validation Error**: "Path `bookingNumber` is required" - **FIXED**
   - **Root Cause**: Pre-save middleware was failing silently and not generating booking numbers
   - **Solution**: Removed problematic middleware and implemented manual generation in payment routes
   - **Status**: Backend deployed and ready for testing

## 🎉 **BOOKING WIZARD IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETED:**
- ✅ **Room Details Step**: Now shows only the selected room with confirmation
- ✅ **Language Context**: Preserved throughout entire booking process
- ✅ **Room Data Integration**: Uses actual backend data instead of hardcoded values
- ✅ **Better UX**: Clear room confirmation and next step guidance

## 🚫 **FEATURES TO HANDLE THROUGH ADMIN PANEL (NOT IN TODO)**
**Note**: The following features will be managed through the admin panel interface, so they are NOT included in the development todo list:
- **Room Management**: CRUD operations, pricing updates, availability settings
- **Booking Management**: View, edit, cancel, status updates
- **User Management**: Guest accounts, admin users, permissions
- **Content Management**: Room descriptions, images, amenities
- **Pricing Control**: Dynamic pricing, seasonal rates, discounts
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Booking statistics, revenue reports, guest analytics
- **Settings Management**: System configuration, email templates, notifications
